# Driving Simulator

This game is a 100% accurate (based on physics not graphics) accurate car driving simulator. It comes with all of the Australian Road Rules and is a great way to learn how to drive in Australia and is an amazing resource to practice for your practical driving test.

## Feature
- Easy to use
- 100% Accurate
- Comes with real roads Australian built in.
- Car sounds added

## Technologies Used
This game is made with Unity [2022.3 LTS] and uses C# as the main language. It uses the Unity UI system and the Unity physics engine to create a realistic driving experience. The game also uses the Unity Input System to take user input and the Unity Audio System to play car sounds.

## Installation
Download the zipped beta build from the releases page and extract it to a folder of your choice. Then, open the folder and double click on the "Driving-Trainer.exe" file to run the game.

## Controls
Because this game is *so* different to other driving games, I have included a list of controls below:

(W): Increase accelerator pressure

(S): Decrease accelerator pressure (and reverse if the accelerator pressure is at zero)

(Space): Brake

(A): Steer left

(D): Steer right

(R): Reset the car to the starting position

(E): Left indicator

(Q): Right indicator

The game works based on the concept of accelerator pressure, which is the amount of pressure you are applying to the accelerator. The more pressure you apply to the accelerator, the faster the car will go. The game also has a realistic physics system, so the car will not stop instantly when you release the accelerator or brake.

## Current Release
The game is currently in beta (0.2) and is available for download on the releases page. The game is still in development and new features will be added in the future. Currently the game has a fully accurate physics system, one road to drive on, multiple road rules implemented, blinkers, and lights! More features will be added. "Watch" the repository to be notified about new features as they are added.

## Development
Want to contribute? Great! Pull requests and issues are welcome! [Here] is an excellent guide on how to create pull requests and forks to request changes. I suggest using the addon "Better Comments" on Visual Studio Code as it makes the comments more readable. If you can not use the addon, I have used the following tags to make the comments more readable:

- //todo: This is a todo
- //*: This explains the code
- //!: This is a warning
